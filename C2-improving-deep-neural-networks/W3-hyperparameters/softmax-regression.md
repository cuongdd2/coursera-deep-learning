## Multiple classification

C = # of classes

t = e ^ (Z[l])

the decision boundary is linear

Z = [5      2       -1      3]
t = [e^5    e^2     e^-1    e^3]
g(z) = [e^5/sum(t)  e^2/sum(t)  ...]
softmax= [0.842    0.042   0.002   0.114]
hardmax= [1     0   0   0]
if C = 2 => softmax reduces to logistic regression
maximum likelihood estimation statistics
