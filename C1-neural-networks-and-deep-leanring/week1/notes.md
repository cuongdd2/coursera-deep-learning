If I want to build a human-simulated learning systems, I will need to build
 - learning system: ask what the system doesn't know yet
 - online, realtime teacher, which the system can ask questions whenever it wants to
 - we need a single / global vocabulary (language) system for the learning process. when the system learn new thing, teacher give back the anwser (labeling ) the data for your
for example: when you see the rainbow first time, you will ask: what is that (in the sky, colorful, half circle shape)
   you got a single word definition for it: rainbow
   the system also needs to identify (extract) key features from data, the ability for pattern recognition or categorize 1 object into multiple catologs within current knowledge
   generalization, comparision are important here
   
little details are curial in the programming, never stop programming and seeing what may go wrong
keep asking questions, use reasoning, logical thinking 
don't worry if everybody else tell it's nonsense

PC = personal computer = helping people with computing/calculating tasks
PH = personal humanoid / assistant = helping people with your daily task, making decision, giving you information
think for you
personal thinker / personal informer / personal AI
