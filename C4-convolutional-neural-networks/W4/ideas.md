When process images, the filter size 3x3 or 5x5 can be calibrated bigger when input image size is bigger
- 608x608 image size in AlexNet with filter 3x3 can be applied as 7x7 for 1024x1024 or 2048x1024 image
- we can use bigger strides to capture pattern in images

Having a notebook/journal to keep track of ideas with some findings, experiment results 
-> review them every 1-2 weeks
-> condense the notes into some trending, useful directions
-> after few months, see what you are heading to, how many ideas you pursue and how many you abandon.
-> rule of thumbs, keeps few ideas and try to go harder
-> another strategy is epsilon-greedy exploration, where 1 day per week you can explore new fields out of your current work

Personal development
- learn the basic from textbook
- learn the trend by theses
- re-implement the idea from paper to get insights

Having strong vision of what I want to achieve
- work proactively toward the vision
- taking personal responsibility for success and failure
- develop disciplined work habits
- balance between self-development / self-improvement and progress or result

Living in proactive fashion is harder than reactive way

- Be Accountable to other people also make you go forward
- Honest to ourselves, by keeping track, monitor, feedback loop of what we actually do
